-- Storage setup for user files
-- Run this AFTER the main setup script

-- 1. Create storage bucket for user files (if it doesn't exist)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'user-files',
  'user-files',
  false,
  52428800, -- 50MB limit
  ARRAY['application/pdf', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'application/msword']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- 2. Create storage policies for user files
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own files" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own files" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own files" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own files" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
